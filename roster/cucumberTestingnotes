To get Cucumber on Ubuntu:
sudo gem install cucumber rspec rspec-rails 
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
sudo gem install webrat



ruby script/generate cucumber

create manage_users.feature in "features" folder
	Feature: Manage Users
	In order to make a roster
	As an administrator
	I want to create and manage users

	Scenario: User List
		Given I have a user named Adam Bray, netid alb64
		And I have a user named Harley Trung, netid dtt22
		When I go to the list of users
		Then I should see "Adam Bray"
		And I should see "Harley Trung"

Terminal: cucumber features 

(or) cucumber features -n User List

Errors we ran into : 
error: Given /^I have a user named Adam Bray, netid alb64$/ do
  pending
end

Solution: change features/step_definitions/user_steps: 
"Given /^I have a user named (.*), netid (.+)$/ do |name, netid|
	User.create!(:name => name, :netid => netid)
end"

Error: expected the following element's content to include "Adam Bray":
      You are being redirected. (Spec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)

Solution: change features/support/paths.rb to add: 
"		when /the list of users/
			users_path"

Yay, it works


Now add another scenario: 

	Scenario: Create valid user
		Given I have no users
		And I am on the list of users
		When I follow "New User"
		And I fill in "Name" with "Adam Bray"
		And I fill in "Netid" with "alb64"
		And I press "Create"
		Then I should see "New User Created."
		And I should see "Adam Bray"
		And I should see "alb64"
		And I should have 1 user

Errors: 
Given /^I have no users$/ do
  pending
end

Then /^I should have 1 user$/ do
  pending
end

Solution: add to user_steps.rb
Given /^I have no users$/ do
  User.delete_all
end

Then /^I should have ([0-9]+) user$/ do |count|          
  User.count.should == count.to_i
end

Error: Could not find button "Create" (Webrat::NotFoundError)
      (eval):2:in `/^I press "([^\"]*)"$/'
      features/manage_users.feature:20:in `And I press "Create"'

Solution: change button to say "Create" in _form.html.erb

Error: Then I should see "New User Created." # features/step_definitions/webrat_steps.rb:93
      expected the following element's content to include "New User Created.":
      User
              Successfully created user.

Solution: change the flash text in users_controller to say "New User Created."
